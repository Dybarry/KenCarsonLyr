        <b>[Intro]</b>
        <i>(Wake up, F1LTHY)</i>
        Huh, huh, huh, huh, huh
        Half of these niggas ain't never seen shit, and these bitches ain't seen shit neither
        When she workout, she rockin' a tracksuit, it's Balenciaga Adidas
        
        <b>[Chorus]</b>
        And this shit don't make no sense
        How I went from broke to rich?
        How the fuck you want me now, back then act like you ain't notice me? (Notice me, notice me)
        Yeah, now I got diamonds, now I got these jewels
        Now these hoes comin' in two
        Now my pockets filled with cash
        Bitch I walk around with them blues, yeah
        Lil' bitch, I walk around with them blues now
        Yeah
        
        <b>[Verse]</b>
        You know how I rock, cut off stacks, keep kush in my pocket
        They treat my swag just like a door the way these niggas knock it
        Bitch, I'm in that mode like Naruto, I'm a nine-tailed fox
        I don't want that ho if she ain't bringin' nothin' to the table but her box
        I been gettin' tired of fuckin'
        And I'm tired of being tired, shit, fuck it
        Everyday I ball out, I make sure I get a bucket
        How the fuck you don't know my middle name but you claim that you love me?
        You don't love me (Love me, love me)
        I know you don't love me
        If a bitch try me, it's gon' get real ugly
        If she wanna leave, I'll let her leave 'cause she already fucked me, huh
        I'm such an asshole
        Money over everything, these niggas gon' fold before my cash fold
        Every time I post on Instagram, I make her mad, oh
        Every time I pop out, you know I'm with a new bad ho, woah
        And you can't relate 'cause what I been doin' lately feels so unreal
        And I get depressed when I notice nobody feel how I feel (How I feel, how I feel, how I feel)
        Yeah, I was wit' the Look Killa tryna catch a kill
        I remember way, way back in the day, we couldn't even afford no meal
        What I spent on purple drank, I could've paid his bills off for a year
        I was Uberin' everywhere, now it's two-twenty on my dash when I steer
        Huh, huh, huh, huh, huh
        Half of these niggas ain't never seen shit, and these bitches ain't seen shit neither
        When she workout, she rockin' a track suit, it's Balenciaga Adidas
        And they say love can never ever be forever, so I'm takin' advantage of the moment
        Bitch, I'm at the top, ain't got no opps, ain't got no opponents
        When you at the top, ain't nobody there, it get real, real lonely
        Everybody say this ho ain't goin', huh, wait 'til I walk up on you
        And this shit don't make no sense, I'm rich, I was dead broke on the corner
       
        <b>[Chorus]</b>
        And this shit don't make no sense
        How I went from broke to rich?
        How the fuck you want me now, back then act like you ain't notice me? (Notice me, notice me, notice me, notice me)
        Yeah, now I got diamonds, now I got these jewels
        Now these hoes comin' in two
        Now my pockets filled with cash
        Bitch, I walk around with them blues, yeah
        Lil' bitch, I walk around with them blues now
        Yeah
        
        <b>[Outro]</b>
        You know how I rock, cut off stacks, keep kush in my pocket
        They treat my swag just like a door the way these niggas knock it
        Bitch, I'm in that mode like Naruto, I'm a nine-tailed fox
        I don't want that ho if she ain't bringin' nothin' to the table but her box
